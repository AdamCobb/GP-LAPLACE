# GP-LAPLACE

A Gaussian process based technique for locating attractors from trajectories in time-varying fields.

This repository contains code used in the experiments of our paper: "Identifying Sources and Sinks in the Presence of Multiple Agents with Gaussian Process Vector Calculus" by Adam D. Cobb, Richard Everett, Andrew Markham, and Stephen J. Roberts.

## Abstract 
In systems of multiple agents, identifying the cause of observed agent dynamics is challenging. Often, these agents operate in diverse, non-stationary environments, where models rely on handcrafted environment-specific features to infer influential regions in the systemâ€™s surroundings. To overcome the limitations of these inflexible models, we present *GP-LAPLACE*, a technique for locating sources and sinks from trajectories in time-varying fields. Using Gaussian processes, we jointly infer a spatio-temporal vector field, as well as canonical vector calculus operations on that field. Notably, we do this from only agent trajectories without requiring knowledge of the environment, and also obtain a metric for denoting the significance of inferred causal features in the environment by exploiting our probabilistic method. To evaluate our approach, we apply it to both synthetic and real-world GPS data, demonstrating the applicability of our technique in the presence of multiple agents, as well as its superiority over existing methods.

## Example

## Reproducing Results
We have created a number of Jupyter notebooks to reproduce our results:

- `exp_synthetic_stationary.ipynb` - Stationary attractors: Simulating agents in a non-stationary potential field.
- `exp_synthetic_varying-strength.ipynb` - Varying-strength attractors: Simulating agents in a potential field with attractors that vary their strength with time. 
- `exp_synthetic_rotating.ipynb` - Rotating attractors: Simulating agents in a potential field with attractors that change location with time.

Each experiment should take no longer than 20 minutes from start to finish (with load_dict=False). Tested on:
- Ubuntu 16.04, 16GB memory, CPU @ 2.60GHz x 8
- Mac, 8GB memory, CPU @ 3.10GHz x 2
